## Project overview:
Mushroom foraging is a hobby enjoyed by many people worldwide. Although misidentifying a mushroom could have deadly consequences. Based on certain phenotypic features, foragers can identify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous, but can a machine do so as well?
**DISCLAIMER:** Do not use this as an actual guide to identify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## Dataset overview:
> *"This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom."* - Text taken from the Kaggle dataset overview

## Streamlit app:
**Important note:** Despite multiple attempts, the Streamlit app classifies all mushrooms as poisonous. I've attempted to fix the issue multiple times but to no avail. If anyone knows how to fix this issue kindly inform me.
### Instructions to run streamlit app:
- Open command prompt and install required packages:
> pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn pickle
- Save streamlit app, named "mushroomclassstreamlit.py" to your laptop
- Run streamlit app (ensure you are working in the same directory where the streamlit app file is located):
> streamlit run mushroomclassstreamlit.py
